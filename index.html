    <p>Hands Of The Farmer is inspired by my father - a farmer who has dedicated his life to planting and nurturing
      coffee fields. His quiet love and passion for agriculture, especially coffee, have shaped not only his journey but
      also my family’s life. From the very beginning, everything was difficult and uncertain, yet through patience,
      endless care, and countless hours of labor, he has grown resilience and harvested abundance. Coffee, for us, is
      more than a crop; it is a symbol of love, perseverance, and livelihood. This project intertwines the narrative of
      coffee’s growth with sound, serving as both a creative exploration and a heartfelt tribute to my father, honoring
      his devotion and the seeds he has sown for our future.</p>
